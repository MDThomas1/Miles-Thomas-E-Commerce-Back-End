## Installation
Currently this application is entirely back-end and needs to be downloaded by the user. Additionally there is a package.json file to download all necessary npm packages.

## Usage
With the now finished back-end for this webpage, interaction with company data is now entirely possible. Routes have been created that will allow for viewing of entire chunks of data or specific pieces that can be accessed with their unique id. In addition, data can also be interacted with and changed according to the needs of the user. Any table of data can be added to or updated, as well as deleted.
